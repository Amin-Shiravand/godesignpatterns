# Design Patterns in Go ðŸŽ¨

Welcome to the **Design Patterns in Go** repository! This collection showcases various software design patterns implemented using the Go programming language. Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems, promoting code reusability, maintainability, and scalability.

## Patterns Included

- **Singleton**: Implement a thread-safe singleton pattern(Basic and Generic version), ensuring a class has only one instance.

- **Builder Pattern Example(Email)**: The Builder pattern allows you to construct complex objects step by step while separating the construction process from the object's representation.

[//]: # (- **Factory Method**: Create objects using a factory method, allowing flexible object creation.)

[//]: # (- **Observer**: Implement the observer pattern to establish a one-to-many dependency between objects.)

[//]: # (- **Decorator**: Dynamically add responsibilities to objects using decorators.)

[//]: # (- **Strategy**: Define a family of interchangeable algorithms and make them interchangeable.)
- ... and more!

Each design pattern comes with a clear explanation, code examples, and usage scenarios to help you understand how to apply them in real-world projects. Whether you're a beginner looking to deepen your understanding of design principles or an experienced developer seeking best practices, this repository provides valuable insights into applying design patterns effectively in Go.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and use these implementations as a reference to enhance your coding skills and create more robust and maintainable software.

Let's master the art of elegant software design together! ðŸš€
